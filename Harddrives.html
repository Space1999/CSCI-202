    <h2>About Harddrives</h2>
    <p>
        There are two types of harddrive: <b>Hard Disk Drives</b> and <b>Solid State Drives</b>.

        <br><br>

        <b>Hard Disk Drives (HDD)</b> store data on a disc by using a lasers to both read information from the disc as well as write to the disc. Information is delivered to the motherboard via a SATA cable.

        <b>Solid State Drives (SSD)</b> themselves come in two types. Both do away with the need for a disc, meaning they have a much smaller form-factor and can read and write information at much faster speeds. The older standard uses the same information delivery method as HDDs, and so is referred to as a SATA SSD. The new standard connects directly to the motherboard using an M.2 slot. This is called an NVME SSD.

        <h3>Comparison</h3>

        While SATA SSDs are faster than HDDs, NVME SSDs are even faster - sometimes twice the speed as even the fastest SATA drives. This makes NVME drives the best on the market when it comes to read and write speeds, so is an excellent choice for Video Games. However this speed comes at a cost. A 1TB NVME SSD can cost around $180. Meanwhile a 2TB HDD may end up costing only $100, making HDDs a cost effective choice if you're looking for a lot of storage capacity. As you might expect, SATA SSDs fall somewhere in-between NVME drives and HDDs when it comes to cost.

        <br><br>

        My personal Recommendation when it comes to harddrives is that HDDs are really good for a storage drive. I use a 2TB HDD to store documents and programs that don't demand fast read and write speeds. They are known to last longer than SSDs and can hold a lot more data for a fraction of the price. Meanwhile if you need a high-performance drive an NVME SSD is well worth it if you can spare the cash. For example - while a SATA drive I have has a speed of 2000mhz, my NVME drive has a speed of 7000mhz. The NVME drive is 3.5x the speed and I got it on sale for $160.
